This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 related to nested routes and dynamic segments.  The bug involves unexpected behavior when a parent route matches multiple path segments, and a child route uses a wildcard (*) segment. The wildcard segment can unintentionally capture portions of the path already consumed by the parent route, leading to incorrect rendering or route matching.  The solution shows how to properly structure your routes to avoid this issue and ensure correct path segment handling within nested routes.
